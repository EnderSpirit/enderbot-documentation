      <description>Getting Started # Setting up Amethyst requires a basic understanding of git. If you are unfamiliar, this resource is a great place to start!&#xA;Forking # A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.&#xA;Navigate to the GitHub repository for the Amethyst project:&#xA;üìÅ Amethyst Repository&#xA;Then, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account.</description>

      <description>Editing # Amethyst runs on top of Hugo so all notes are written in Markdown.&#xA;Folder Structure # Here&amp;rsquo;s a rough overview of what&amp;rsquo;s what.&#xA;All notes you want to publish should go in the /content folder. To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any subfolder you&amp;rsquo;d like.&#xA;To edit the main home page, open /content/_index.</description>

      <description>Setup # Obsidian is the preferred way to use Amethyst. You can either create a new Obsidian Vault or link one that your already have.&#xA;New Vault # If you don&amp;rsquo;t have an existing Vault, download Obsidian and create a new Vault in the /content folder that you created and cloned during the setup step.&#xA;Linking an existing Vault (simple) # The easiest way to use an existing Vault is to copy all of your files (directory and hierarchies intact) into the /content folder.</description>

If you are using a &amp;lt;YOUR-USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io domain, you can skip this step.&#xA;For this last bit to take effect, you also need to create a CNAME record with the DNS provider you register your domain with (i.e. NameCheap, Google Domains).&#xA;GitHub has some documentation on this, but the tldr; is to&#xA;Go to your forked repository (github.</description>

      <description>Edit ignoreFiles in config.yaml to include paths you&amp;rsquo;d like to exclude from being rendered.&#xA;... ignoreFiles: [ &amp;#34;/content/templates/*&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;/content/private/*&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;&amp;lt;your path here&amp;gt;&amp;#34; ] ignoreFiles supports the use of Regular Expressions (RegEx) so you can ignore patterns as well (e.g. ignoring all .pngs by doing \\.png$). To ignore a specific file, you can also add the tag draft: true to the frontmatter of a note.&#xA;--- title: Some Private Note draft: true --- .</description>

      <description>Amethyst supports two modes of searching through content.&#xA;Full-text # Full-text search is the default in Amethyst. It produces results that exactly match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.&#xA;# the default option enableSemanticSearch: false Natural Language # Natural language search is powered by Operand. It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.</description>

      <description>Still having trouble? Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Amethyst.&#xA;Does Amethyst have Latex support? # Yes! See LaTeX for a brief demo.&#xA;Can I use &amp;lt;Obsidian Plugin&amp;gt; in Amethyst? # Unless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Amethyst.&#xA;The easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.</description>

      <description>Haven&amp;rsquo;t updated Amethyst in a while and want all the cool new optimizations? On Unix/Mac systems you can run the following command for a one-line update! This command will show you a log summary of all commits since you last updated, press q to acknowledge this. Then, it will show you each change in turn and press y to accept the patch or n to reject it. Usually you should press y for most of these unless it conflicts with existing changes you&amp;rsquo;ve made!</description>
