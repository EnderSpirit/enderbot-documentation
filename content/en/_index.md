## What is Amethyst?
Amethyst is a free [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) alternative that is derived from two existing projects, [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and [Hugo Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book).

The purpose of Amethyst is to provide a space to publish more structured notes created in Obsidian that may not fit in the [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden/) archetype that is well-supported by existing projects.

Amethyst was primarily created as a theme for my [course notes](https://notes.bencuan.me).
